## App Privacy Policy

The Friends Library app (iOS and Android) neither collects nor transmits any personally
identifiable data (PID). There is no tracking or telemetry of any kind. The Friends
Library app does not display any advertisements, and shares no data of any kind with any
third-party service.

All app user preferences (such as audio quality settings) are stored locally only on the

or any third party whatsoever.

The Friends Library is (and always will be) free of charge, and Friends Library is a

whatsoever to track or monetize or share any data, nor do we at this time collect any data
at all about our users usage of the app.
